# Heading Outline Checker

> A clean heading tree, and the structure problems search engines and screen readers trip on.

**Live demo:** https://0xelitesystem.github.io/heading-outline-checker/

Single HTML file. Runs in the browser with no build step, no server, no tracking, and no data leaving the page.

## What it does

- Reads HTML or markdown and extracts the heading levels in order
- Draws the outline as an indented tree so the document shape is obvious
- Flags more than one h1, skipped levels, and empty headings
- Updates live as you edit the source

## What it is not

- Not a full HTML validator. It looks at heading structure only
- Not an accessibility audit on its own, though heading order is part of one

## Use

Open the hosted page: https://0xelitesystem.github.io/heading-outline-checker/

Or download `index.html` and open it in any browser. It works offline.

1. Choose HTML or Markdown.
2. Paste your source into the Paste source box.
3. Read the indented outline tree as it updates live.
4. Fix the flagged issues: more than one h1, skipped levels, or empty headings.

## Why this exists

A broken heading structure hurts both screen-reader navigation and how search engines read a page, and it is hard to see in raw source. This tool draws the outline and flags the problems. It is one HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript: no account, no tracking, no analytics, no external scripts or fonts, and it works offline. MIT licensed, so you can fork it, self-host it, or read every line.

## Privacy

Everything runs client-side. No analytics, no cookies, no network calls, and nothing you paste is stored. The only thing written to storage is your light or dark theme choice, saved in localStorage under the key `theme`.

## Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xelitesystem/heading-outline-checker
cd heading-outline-checker
```

Then open `index.html` in any modern browser. Or serve the folder with `python -m http.server 8000` and visit http://localhost:8000.

## Build

No build step. The whole tool is one `index.html` with no dependencies, so there is nothing to install or compile.
